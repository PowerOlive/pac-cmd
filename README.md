# pac-cmd

A command line tool to change proxy auto-config settings of operation system. Binaries included. Simply `make` to build it.

# Usage

```sh
pac [on  <pac url> | off]
```

*  **Mac**: Have to `sudo` as setting pac is an privileged action.

*  **Windows**: Install [MinGW-W64](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64) to build pac, as it has up to date SDK headers we require.
